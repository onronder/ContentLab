# Handling Traffic Spikes in ContentCreate

This document outlines the infrastructure and strategies implemented to handle traffic spikes in the ContentCreate application.

## Overview

The ContentCreate application uses a combination of serverless architecture, caching, and rate limiting to ensure stability during high traffic periods. By leveraging Vercel's edge network and Supabase's distributed database, we can scale automatically to meet demand.

## Key Components

### 1. Serverless Architecture

- **Vercel Edge Functions**: Our application is deployed on Vercel, which provides automatic scaling for the frontend.
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Background processing tasks run as serverless functions that can scale independently.
- **Worker System**: Long-running tasks are offloaded to background workers to prevent frontend blocking.

### 2. Caching Strategy

- **Edge Caching**: Static assets and pages are cached at the edge using Vercel's global CDN.
- **Application-Level Cache**:
  - Content analysis results are cached to prevent redundant processing.
  - Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce database load.

### 3. Rate Limiting

- **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented at both the edge and application levels.
- **Progressive Rate Limits**: Higher limits for authenticated users, lower for unauthenticated.
- **IP-based and User-based Limits**: Prevents abuse while allowing legitimate use.

### 4. Database Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management.
- **Read Replicas**: Separating read and write operations for better performance.
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized queries and appropriate indexing.

### 5. Queue System

- **Job Queue**: Analysis requests are queued and processed asynchronously.
- **Priority Queuing**: Premium users' jobs get higher priority.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Failed jobs are automatically retried with exponential backoff.

## Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting Implementation

```typescript
// Rate limiter middleware for API routes
export const rateLimiter = new RateLimiterRedis({
  storeClient: redisClient,
  keyPrefix: 'ratelimit',
  points: Number(process.env.RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS) || 10, // Number of requests
  duration: Number(process.env.RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS) || 60, // Per minute
});

// Apply to API routes
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    // Identify client by IP or user ID
    const identifier = req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.connection.remoteAddress;
    
    // Apply rate limiting
    await rateLimiter.consume(identifier);
    
    // Process request
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof RateLimiterRes) {
      return res.status(429).json({
        error: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
        retryAfter: Math.round(error.msBeforeNext / 1000) || 60
      });
    }
    
    // Handle other errors
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Worker Queue Implementation

The worker system uses a queue to process analysis jobs asynchronously:

```typescript
// In supabase/functions/worker/index.ts
async function processJob(jobId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Process with timeout protection and retries
  // ...
}

async function checkStalledJobs(): Promise<string[]> {
  // Reset stalled jobs to retry them
  // ...
}
```

### Connection Pooling

```sql
-- In migrations/0011_connection_pooling.sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Configure connection pooling
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = '200';
ALTER SYSTEM SET superuser_reserved_connections = '4';
ALTER SYSTEM SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '30000';

-- Create connection pool management function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION manage_connection_pool()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Close idle connections that are older than 1 hour
  PERFORM pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
  FROM pg_stat_activity 
  WHERE state = 'idle' AND state_change < now() - interval '1 hour';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Schedule connection pool maintenance
SELECT cron.schedule('connection_pool_maintenance', '*/30 * * * *', 'SELECT manage_connection_pool()');
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

- **Health Checks**: Regular worker health checks to detect issues early.
- **Alerting System**: Automated alerts for abnormal traffic patterns or system performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Dashboard for monitoring API response times and error rates.

## Scaling Plan

### Current Capacity

- Supports up to 100 concurrent users with current configuration.
- Can handle approximately 10,000 requests per hour.

### Scaling Triggers

- **Auto-scaling**: When CPU utilization exceeds 70% for more than 5 minutes.
- **Manual scaling**: For anticipated traffic spikes (e.g., marketing campaigns).

### Scale-Up Procedure

1. Increase worker count and connection pool size.
2. Adjust rate limits if necessary.
3. Enable additional caching layers.

## Emergency Procedures

In case of unexpected traffic spikes:

1. Activate stricter rate limiting to protect core functionality.
2. Enable maintenance mode for non-essential features.
3. Scale up infrastructure according to the scaling plan.
4. Monitor system health and adjust response as needed.

## Future Improvements

- Implement Redis for distributed caching and more robust rate limiting.
- Add geographic distribution of processing resources.
- Implement circuit breakers for non-critical components.
- Develop automatic scaling based on ML-predicted traffic patterns.

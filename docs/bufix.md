Remaining Issues (for further work):
Several 'any' types still need to be properly typed in various files
Some unused variables remain (like 'data' in QuotaRequestList)
A few react-hooks/exhaustive-deps warnings in useSystemMonitoring.ts
Some unnecessary 'supabase' dependencies in hooks
Some variables only used as types need to be addressed
To continue fixing these issues, I would recommend:
Create proper interfaces instead of using 'any' types
Remove or properly use variables marked as unused
Fix remaining hook dependencies by using useCallback or moving functions

# Content Roadmap Tool - Technical Architecture

## System Overview

The Content Roadmap Tool is a web application designed to analyze content from a user's website and competitor websites to identify content gaps and popular themes. The system is built on modern cloud infrastructure with a focus on scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with React
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks, Context API
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Cloudflare Pages

### Backend
- **API Layer**: Supabase Edge Functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for report exports)
- **Background Processing**: Worker pool with pg_listen/notify or separate worker service

### Data Processing
- **Web Scraping**: Custom scraper with fetch API and DOM parsing
- **Text Processing**: NLP pipeline with tokenization, stemming, and text analysis
- **Content Analysis**: Custom algorithms for gap identification and theme extraction
- **Reporting**: Server-side report generation

## Data Flow

1. **Content Analysis Process**:
   ```
   User Input → API Gateway → Job Queue → Worker Pool → Content Scraper →
   Text Processor → Analysis Engine → Database → Results API → Frontend
   ```

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   ```
   User Login → Supabase Auth → JWT Token → Session Management →
   Authorization Middleware → Protected API Routes/Resources
   ```

3. **Report Generation**:
   ```
   User Request → API Gateway → Report Generator → Data Retrieval →
   Template Engine → Report Format (PDF/CSV) → Storage → Download Link
   ```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### users (handled by Supabase Auth)
- id: UUID (PK)
- email: TEXT
- ...other Supabase Auth fields

#### projects
- id: UUID (PK)
- user_id: UUID (FK to users)
- name: TEXT
- user_url: TEXT
- competitor_urls: TEXT[]
- created_at: TIMESTAMP

#### analysis_jobs
- id: UUID (PK)
- project_id: UUID (FK to projects)
- user_id: UUID (FK to users)
- status: TEXT (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- user_url: TEXT
- competitor_urls: TEXT[]
- content_gaps: TEXT[]
- popular_themes: TEXT[]
- error_message: TEXT
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- started_at: TIMESTAMP
- completed_at: TIMESTAMP

#### content_items (future)
- id: UUID (PK)
- project_id: UUID (FK to projects)
- source_url: TEXT
- title: TEXT
- content: TEXT

## Scaling Considerations

### Database Scaling
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Partitioning for historical data
- Read replicas for report generation

### Processing Scaling
- Worker pool auto-scaling
- Distributed job processing
- Priority queues for job types

### API Scaling
- Edge function distribution
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Caching of common results

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Secure API access with JWT authentication

### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits

### Compliance
- Data retention policies
- GDPR compliance features
- Data export capabilities

## Monitoring & Observability

### Performance Monitoring
- Function execution metrics
- Database query performance
- Frontend interaction timings

### Error Tracking
- Structured error logging
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Alert thresholds and notifications

### Usage Analytics
- User activity tracking
- Feature usage metrics
- System load monitoring

## Development & Deployment

### Development Workflow
- Feature branches
- Pull request reviews
- CI/CD pipeline

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Deployment Pipeline
